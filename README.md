# Modeling GDP per Capita

While GDP, or gross domestic product, is the most widely used measure of a country’s economic activity, GDP per capita is a much better indicator of a nation’s living standards since it adjusts for population differences between countries. I performed a regression analysis on GDP data in order to investigate factors that predict GDP per capita on a country level.

The results from this analysis can serve to inform public policy decisions that may ultimately influence GDP per capita at a national level. The ability to make better data-driven decisions based on new insights is a key component of data science and one that should not be limited to data scientists and analytics professionals.
